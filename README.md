OpenSuSE-yast2-dirinstall
=========================

Build Project fo  yast2-dirinstall on  OpenSuSE
We had need to get yast2-dirinstall back to work , as we still use XEN since it exists :-).


Support NOTE : 
yast2-dirinstall  install got discontinued at Opensuse 13.1.
Bad idea  to remove this as many Admins still use it for XEN image Builds.


Module-Status with Opensuse 13.1 : it still installs the rpms as wanted :-)
